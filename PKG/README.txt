PKG offline test bundle

How to test
1) Open index.html (file:// works).
2) Use the header Package dropdown:
   - Starter Graph
   - Slime (PKG demo)
   - Knight (PKG demo)
   - Chest with Treasure (HS)
3) Click New Card to apply the selected package.
   Note: registry is global, so a new card/package overwrites prior cards.
4) Drop a sprite sheet image into Assets to see rendering.

Pop-out viewer
- viewer.html and viewer.js are included beside index.html.
